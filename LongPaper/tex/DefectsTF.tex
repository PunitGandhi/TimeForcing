Using an oscillation with a period of 50 and centered about $r_0=-0.27$ and amplitude of $\rho =0.1$, we can see the trajectory taken by the initial localized solution as it approaches a domain filling one (Fig.~\ref{fig:FillDomain}).  The solution grows by nucleating a period on each front at each oscillation of the forcing parameter. This happens until the solution reaches 39 periods, at which point it seems to get stuck.  Eventually it fills the domain with a 40 period solution.  This is in contrast to the case with a constant forcing that grows into the domain with a 39 period solution.

The solution (a) grows in time, eventually filling the domain and the corresponding trajectory along the max value - L2 norm phase space slice (b) shows the path taken as it passes in and out of the snaking region . }

\section{Stability, Growth, and Decay of localized solutions under large oscillations }
\subsection{Periodic oscillations of the solution}

We now turn to oscillations of the forcing with an amplitude greater than that of the pinning region.   In this case, the system  initialized with a localized solution that is stable at the center of the oscillation will spend its time alternating between growth and decay.  When the growth exactly balances the decay, periodic solutions are produced that ``breathe" with the oscillation period. Given a particular oscillation amplitude, we find a range of values for the oscillation center for which these periodic solutions can exist at each value of the oscillation period.  While the general trend of the range is to narrow for increasing oscillation periods, it does not narrow monotically -- ``sweet spots" where the range is larger than the pinched regions above and below occur at regular intervals of the oscillation period.  As we increase the oscillation amplitude, the  pinching regions are stretched out and shifted to less negative values of $r_0$.

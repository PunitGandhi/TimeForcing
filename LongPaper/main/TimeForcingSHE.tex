\begin{abstract}
Systems with a periodic forcing in time abound!  We use the generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation with a quadratic-cubic nonlinearity as test-bed for studying localized pattern formation in such systems with a periodic forcing in time.  We apply a sinisiodal linear forcing to the SHE and study the dependence of localization on the amplitude, oscillation period, and offset of the forcing.  As one might expect, the region of existence of stable localized solutions dramatically decreases as the system is ``jiggled."  The parameter space within the pinning region of the constant forcing case, however, is partitioned into regions of growth, stability, and decay with an unexpected structure when large oscillations are applied.

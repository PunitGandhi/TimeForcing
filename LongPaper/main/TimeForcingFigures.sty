\caption{\label{fig:BurkeSHE}This figure was taken from Burke\cite{} (a) Bifurcation diagram showing the snakes-and-ladders structure of localized states. Away from the origin the snaking branches $L_0$ and $L_-$ are contained within the snaking region (shaded) between$E_-$ and $E_+$, where $r(E_-)\approx -0.3390$ and $r(E_+)\approx -0.2593$.   Solid (dotted) lines indicate stable (unstable) states. In addition, the Maxwell point $M$, occurring at $r(M)\approx -0.3128$  is indicated with a vertical dash-dot line.  The saddle node bifurcation that creates the stable periodic state occurs at $r<r(SN_P)\approx -0.3744$, defining the left edge of the bistability region.  We will also find it useful to define the center of the snaking region $C$, which corresponds to  the forcing parameter $r(C)\approx -0.2992$. (b) Sample localized profiles $u(x): (i-iv)$ lie on $L_0$, near onset and at the 1st, 3rd, and 5th saddle-nodes from the bottom, respectively; (v-viii) lie on $L_-$, near onset and at the 1st, 3rd, and 5th saddle-nodes, respectively. Parameters: $b = 1.8$.}

We see that the solution oscillates between growing and stable for this region, as expected given Fig.~\ref{fig:Vcm01}.  The value of $V_{cm}$ is given in number of periods nucleated or decayed over the course of the simulation (2000 units of time), assuming no boundary.}

(b) $T_{\text{osc}}=80$ produces a stable defect state that has been presists for simulations all the way to T=20,000.  The norm of the difference of the solution at the same phase of each oscillation decays exponentially, indicated the solution is infact stable.

A hole state is initialized with $\rho=0.1$ for different values of $r_0$ and $T_{\text{osc}}$, and the ratio of the value of the field at the center to that at the edge at T=20,000 is plotted here.  The blue region corresponds to solutions that had a hole at the center of the domain persist for the entire simulation.  The red regions correspond to where a peak has formed at the center, indicated that the simulation has settled on a periodic solution with 40 periods.  The dark blue region corresponds to small negative troughs at the center of the domain, indicated that a periodic solution of 39 periods has been reached.  The white corresponds to regions where a localized solution remains stable on average.}

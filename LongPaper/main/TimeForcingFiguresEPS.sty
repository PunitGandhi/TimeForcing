\caption{\label{fig:BurkeSHE}This figure was taken from Burke\cite{} (a) Bifurcation diagram showing the snakes-and-ladders structure of localized states. Away from the origin the snaking branches $L_0$ and $L_-$ are contained within the snaking region (shaded) between$E_-$ and $E_+$, where $r(E_-)\approx -0.3390$ and $r(E_+)\approx -0.2593$.   Solid (dotted) lines indicate stable (unstable) states. In addition, the Maxwell point $M$, occurring at $r(M)\approx -0.3128$  is indicated with a vertical dash-dot line.  The saddle node bifurcation that creates the stable periodic state occurs at $r<r(SN_P)\approx -0.3744$, defining the left edge of the bistability region.  We will also find it useful to define the center of the snaking region $C$, which corresponds to  the forcing parameter $r(C)\approx -0.2992$. (b) Sample localized profiles $u(x): (i-iv)$ lie on $L_0$, near onset and at the 1st, 3rd, and 5th saddle-nodes from the bottom, respectively; (v-viii) lie on $L_-$, near onset and at the 1st, 3rd, and 5th saddle-nodes, respectively. Parameters: $b = 1.8$.}

The theory is valid for approximately $\delta<10^{-4}$.  (b) the front speed as a function of the forcing parameter outside of the pinning region. We note that the initial solution used in these simulations was on a saddle node bifurcation of snaking branch at the closest edge of the pinning region and the calculations were done on a domain of 160 characteristic wavelengths.  The decay rate is faster than the nucleation rate given the same distance from the pinning region, and the decaying solutions stop depinning near $r=r(SN_P)$ where an overall amplitude decay mode takes over. }
